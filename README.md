# ka4-today-bot

A lightweight, serverless Telegram bot built with AWS Lambda, OpenAI Assistants API, and Node.js.  
It processes a simple webhook message, interacts with OpenAI to generate a response, and sends it back via Telegram.

## üìê Architecture
<img src="assets/ka4-today.arch.png">

- **Telegram Webhook** via **API Gateway (HTTP API) ‚Üí Lambda**
- **Asynchronous processing** via a second Lambda (asyncProcessor) invoked with InvokeFunction
- **Integration with OpenAI Assistants API v2** (threads, runs, messages, functions)
- **Structured logging** with ### LABEL:start/stop, distinguishing api-level and low-level errors
- **Custom HTTP client** with timeouts, hidden responses, and semantic errorClass
- **DynamoDB** for storing Telegram users (chat_id, username, etc.) + GSI ActiveUsersIndex
- **CloudWatch** Logs and Dashboards with key metrics like Invocations, Errors
---

## ‚≠ê Features
- **Secure webhook** with x-telegram-bot-api-secret-token validation
- Handles /start command and registers user in DB
- Mark users as inactive users after receiving Telegram 403 errors (e.g., bot blocked)
- **Daily cron-based message broadcast** via ka4today-cron-daily-message Lambda
- **Personalized messages** based on OpenAI assistant and the day of the week
- **Localization support** for messages (multi-language)
- **Prompt dictionary** stored in DynamoDB for consistent responses
- **Personalized workout generation** custom daily workout plan for the user, based on their preferences and available exercise

## üöÄ Running Locally

> Requires Node.js 22+

1. Clone the repo
2. Copy a `.env.sample` file and rename it to `.env` :
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Test individual handlers (via [AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli.html)):

Run entrypoint:
```bash
npm run local -- Ka4TodayTelegramWebhook event-samples/telegram-event.json
```

Run async processor
```bash
npm run local -- Ka4TodayAsyncTelegramProcessor event-samples/daily-workout.json
```
